<h4><a name="Clan Jade Falcon Missions"><font color="#12C9FE">Clan
Jade Falcon Missions</font></a></h4>

<p><a name="MW2 - CJF - Silent Thunder"><font color="#C0C0C0">Silent
Thunder</font></a><font color="#C0C0C0"> - This is a very basic
mission, the main challenge being to follow you NAV sequence and
blow up any opposition you come across, several diffrent Mech
types will work well in this mission, just so long as they have
ok speed and fire power. The most difficult part might be picking
your way through the rocky terrain. Take time and work your way
around the biggest rocks; use a fast Mech if you don't have the
patience for slow navigation</font></p>

<p><a name="Arkham Bridge"><font color="#C0C0C0">Arkham Bridge</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This is another simple mission that requires
you to follow you NAV seqence and blow up numerous small enemies.
You will have to dight several bad guys as you run through the
first few NAV points, then eventually you'll reach the Industial
Base. Wolf Mechs will be standing around taking pot shots at it
and you'll get a very easy first shot at each Mech before they
turn around so make it count. Beyond this, just fight well and
you'll certainly succeed. If you discover that the base is
destroyed before you get there, you will need to either dispatch
your first few enemies faster or get a faster Mech.</font></p>

<p><a name="Mirror Cage"><font color="#C0C0C0">Mirror Cage</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This Mission sounds tough but really isn't
don't take that fast of a Mech because you are really close to
the Dropship. You should first take out the Mechs and then Blow
up the Dropship. Don't worry about the Trucks around it they are
worth no points. Take either a lot of Beam Weapons of a hole lot
of extra ammo because it takes a while to destroy the Dropship.
Make sure you have a lot of beam weapons because the Drop Ship
can take a lot of punishment.</font></p>

<p><a name="Bone Machine"><font color="#C0C0C0">Bone Machine</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> -This Mission can be very hard because of all
the Mechs. First you should take a Star Mate with Streak SRM's so
that he doesn't shot your base accidentally. You should always
stay near the base hitting the E button to target the nearest
enemy Mech make sure you have a powerfull Mech. Take out the
Mech's quickly so they don't destroy the base and this mission
will be over. </font></p>

<p><a name="Bouk Obelisk"><font color="#C0C0C0">Bouk Obelisk</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> -In this mission you're essentially on defense,
but you don't have to follow the NAV sequence until you encounter
a swam of enemy Mechs. If you can smash through them all, you'll
then need to do is return to the Isotope Processor where you
started the mission and defend it from a small wave of Mecs. It
will be to your advantage to bring a starmate with you to help
absorb some of the damage.</font></p>

<p><a name="Umber Wall"><font color="#C0C0C0">Umber Wall</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - In this mission your going to have a hard time
if you use a slow Mech with beam weapons because the main attack
comes from the air, you should bring along a lot of LRM-20's plus
Jump Jets. Once you get to a Mountain wall you must go to the
left where there is a hole in the mountain, waiting there for the
train will be a Dire Wolf plus other nasty enemies. (Get around
the Mountain Very Fast or they will destroy the train.</font></p>

<p><a name="Rogue Chariot"><font color="#C0C0C0">Rogue Chariot</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0">- This mission is Fairly easy and Very fun. First
take out the tanks waiting around the corner then turn to the
bridge. Take out the beams that are under the Mechs and the Mechs
will fall to there doom (Don't hit the Mechs.) When you blow up
the Heat Sink array run as fast as you can to Nav Tau of you will
be caught in the Blast Radius.</font></p>

<p><a name="Plum Wine"><font color="#C0C0C0">Plum Wine</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - Plum Wine is one of those annoying missions
where you must intercept moving vehicles. Time is important so a
slow Mech will not work. Take a fast Mech with lots of beam
weapons and perhaps som Streak SRM's for good measure. Follow the
NAV points and on your way destroy all Mechs and inspect the
trucks then destroy them. Or you can just destroy all of them if
you feel you have time. Just keep following the NAV Points
destroying every enemy in yur way.</font></p>

<p><a name="Rust Heart"><font color="#C0C0C0">Rust Heart</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This mission is a slug-fest on a crystalline
world. It is also another moving-vehicle mission, only this time
you must defend the moving vehicles instead of destroying them.
This is fairly easy if you take the right Mechs for the job; it's
impossible if you do not. You and your starmates need big, fast
Mechs with reasonable firepower, and the speed to get ahead of
the convoy. You start the mission next to the convoy so it's just
a matter of joining it and then walking out in front of it,
scaning the murky horizon for bad guys. When Wolf Mechs appear
you should run to intercept them, destroy them and quickly get
back to the convoy to deal with the inevitable attack from the
other direction.</font></p>

<p><a name="Armor Veil"><font color="#C0C0C0">Armor Veil</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This is a very hard mission because there are
so many Mechs so take 2 Star Mates along. First take out the
First wave quick then rush back to intercept the second wave.
Next go to the third wave there will be a Sumoner take him out
first because he has a lot of Missiles and he will blow up the
base all by him self. After you destroy him finish off the next
couple of waves and then you will be done.</font></p>

<p><a name="Bronze Anvil"><font color="#C0C0C0">Bronze Anvil</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This mission is Very Hard Most likely the
Hardest of all the Missions. Take Two powerful starmates. For
yourself take a strong Mech that can move at fairly good speeds
or use jump jets(Warhawk is my favorite for this mission) Blow up
the tanks that attack you as fast as you can because they pack a
punch. Next take out the Helicopters quick. Run as fast as you
can and intercept the Dire wolf inspect him then Destroy him. You
should send the Star Mates after the Battle Master. Next head to
the transports inspect them all then destroy them there are also
a few mechs at the end you will have to get ride of but there not
that hard. (Good Luck!) </font></p>

<h4><a name="Clan Wolf Missions"><font color="#12C9FE">Clan Wolf
Missions</font></a></h4>

<p><a name="Pyre Light"><font color="#C0C0C0">Pyre Light</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This mission is a fairly easy mission first
you should take the Mech that they provide for you it is the best
one you can use. When in the mission proceed to the Chemical
Plant you will encounter a few enemies but there easy to get rid
of with your LRM's next start blasting away at the Chemical
Plant(take your time.) After you have destroyed it head to NAV
Zeta you will encounter a Fire Moth first hit him with 2 of 3
shoots of LRM-20's next you will encounter a Nova I suggest you
save some LRM's for this guy. After you destroy him inspect the
large object in the center and you will then have completed the
mission.</font></p>

<p><a name="Flame Tongue"><font color="#C0C0C0">Flame Tongue</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - In this mission you should take a well armed
Mech because there are a lot of things to destroy. First destroy
the group of Mechs at the beginning of the mission. Next head to
where they where headed and soon you will run into another Mech
and a little further down a small outpost blow up every thing.
Next go back the way you came and look for the Hardened HQ there
will be a Mech and 4 Lasers cannons waiting for you there after
you destroyed the Lasers and Mech then take out the base.(You
should get the Laser cannons first.)</font></p>

<p><a name="Blade Splint"><font color="#C0C0C0">Blade Splint</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This mission can be super easy if you do it
the way I say. First design a mech that can go as fast as you can
make it. I suggest a Storm Crow with about 6 Jump Jets and armed
with only some missiles and lasers and if you still have room add
more Jump Jets. when you start you are facing North the Power
Converter is to the east and a little north. The object is to get
to the Power Converter as fast as you can without getting hit by
enemies. Blow up the converter after inspection then head back
the way you came but instead of going on the left side of the
long rode go on the right keep going till you see the dropship on
radar. Once you see it on Radar run as fast as you can to get to
it. </font></p>

<p><a name="Temper Edge"><font color="#C0C0C0">Temper Edge</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This mission is very easy first escort the
spider like thing to where it needs to go. When enemies attack
you get to them quick and destroy them quick. That's it.</font></p>

<p><a name="Sable Flame"><font color="#C0C0C0">Sable Flame</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - The object of this mission is to destroy Mechs
quick so take a very good Mech. First destroy the three mechs
around the dome. Next head out a little way to intercept two more
Mechs(Don't get close to any Dropships or else you will be
blasted with all kinds of weapons. Next another couple groups
will attack the Dome from the east so get them and you will be
just about done. </font></p>

<p><a name="Burning Chrome"><font color="#C0C0C0">Burning Chrome</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This mission is very hard because of one real
powerful Summoner. You should take a extra Star Mate along with
you for this mission. First destroy the first two mechs with you
and your Star Mate next head to the Solar Array. There is a big
mountain in the center of the canyon on the other side is a Drop
Ship and two mechs(Don't go back there) The Mad Dog will be the
first Mech to attack he is Fairly easy. Next a very Powerful
Summoner will attack you take tons of AC-20 ammo. After he is
destroyed the rest is simple just destroy the Solar Arrays on top
of a cliff. (Watch out for the laser cannons).</font></p>

<p><a name="Scorching Sand"><font color="#C0C0C0">Scorching Sand</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> -You will need a Mech With Jump Jets For this
Mission or else you will be tacking damage before you even see a
Mech. When you Jump of the Cliff destroy the two Jenners then
follow the Nav points till you encounter two Elemental's use some
Streak SRM's to get rid of them. Next you will find the Command
Vehicle. Ignore it at first because a Riffleman will drop off the
side of a Mountain and start shooting the Vehicle. From there you
must just slug it out and get to the Dustoff zone.</font></p>

<p><a name="Silver Staff"><font color="#C0C0C0">Silver Staff</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - You presumably have help in this mission, in
the form of the 37th Stiker Cluster. Prentend they don't exist.
Follow your NAV points and desrtoy any enemy Mechs that attempt
to get too close. This is one of those missions where you have
lots of ground targets to destroy as well as several enemies, So
don't use a Mech with limited projectile weapons. And don't worry
to much about speed; it's not as critical as the mission briefing
would have you belive. Power is more important. Destroy the
Chemical Plant and NAV Phi and continue to NAV Chi, where you
must destroy the Airbase. There are many parts to this Airbase,
so you'll have to blast away for a while. Do the same with the
Industrial Plant and HPG Processor, if necessary. Inspect all
buildings you come accross with 'I' in order to achive your
secondary mission goals. Remember you are not supposed to destroy
the nonessential buildings just inspect them. Just attack only
the Mechs that are attacking you and only achive the primary and
secondary objectives and if you still have time destroy the rest
of the Mechs.</font></p>

<p><a name="Aquiline Fire"><font color="#C0C0C0">Aquiline Fire</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This was a very hard mission for me because I
could never find the Drop Ship. Follow the Nav points and Destroy
the well armed Mech's that you encounter. Take a very strong Mech
with LRM's. Once you reach the last Nav Point head North and
there you will find the Drop Ship Wreckage. After that there are
no more Mech's just go back to your Drop Ship and it will all be
over with. </font></p>

<p><a name="Cold Crescent"><font color="#C0C0C0">Cold Crescent</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - First take a Mech very well armed and with
some Jump Jets. You will first fight a Mech at the beginning of
the mission. After that head North. You will be scanned by a Mech
to se if your IFF code is right.(Don't shoot anything till your
computer says your code is no longer working). Destroy the Mech
outside of the Gate as soon as your Code stops working. The gates
will open and the Mech's inside will run out to intercept you.
You will see a large building to your left when you walk in. Walk
around it clockwise there will be a ventilation shaft at the beck
of the building. Blow up the Shaft then destroy the Core. After
that run like crazy back to your ship or you will be caught in
the blast radius.</font></p>

<p><a name="Velvet Hammer"><font color="#C0C0C0">Velvet Hammer</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - You need a Mech with good shot power and
reasonable speed to finish this mission. Your primary goal is to
follow a Hover Limo and gaurd it. The trick is to destroy your
opposition quickly and stay slightly ahead of the limo otherwise
you will crash into the limo and damage it. Follow the Limo at
the very start of the mission and destroy the first enemy Mech
you find, using medium lasers. It will take a while without
AC-20's but you have some time to fight this Mech. Now catch up
to the Limo. The limo will deviate from its predetermined path
and your computer will give you a warning message. Don't worry
this is supposed to happen.</font></p>

<p><a name="Golden Spade"><font color="#C0C0C0">Golden Spade</font></a><font
color="#C0C0C0"> - This mission is extremely Hard so take Star
Mates I suggest you all should be either Dire Wolf's of
Warhawk's. You will have to fight 2 huge Warhawks at the
beginning of the mission. Once you have destroyed them move north
to the blockade and destroy it completely. After that a third
Warhawk will attack you so send your Star Mates after him. You
need to inspect the Complex right but you can't because of the
shield. The shield generator is hidden in a hole in the ground.
This hole is behind and to the left of the palace as seen from
the roadblock you are to destroy. It's 1.7km at heading 330 from
Nav Alpha. Again, the generator is blue and glowing... satellite
view may help.. Blow it up and the Shields go down. Next you will
encounter some medium sized Mechs. If you still have ammunition
and are in OK condition then they won't be so bad. Inspect the
Complex then Blow it up and the mission will be all done.</font></p>
